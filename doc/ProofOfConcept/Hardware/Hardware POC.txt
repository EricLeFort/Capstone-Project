Hardware POC:

1. being able to move away from the active table space to not interfere with the balls


2. counting steps to know the current location and orientation of the end-effector
3. avoiding recoil from the motion of striking the ball
4. controlling the strength of the striker so that it can score at different distances
5. being able to reach all locations on the table (are there any shots we wont be able to reach?)
6. providing power supplies to all the necessary components
7. Figure out if mottors will be able to move the robot. Make estimate of weight and see which motor specs do we need
8. adequate emerg shut off controls
