3.3 Relevant Facts and Assumptions

F - measurements and physical properties
A - Table/balls uniform/flat/even
A - No mid shot interference
A - balls never leave lift off the table


// 

3.1 Mandated Constraints

Only "standard" shots will be made
	def "standard shots":	No backspin, curves, bounce, trick shots, etc.
System will be customized for specific table
Not breaking
No motion further than 2ft away from table (in the plane of the table)
No motion/components further than 4ft above the surface of the table
Speed cannot reach dangerous speed
No applying chalk
The microcontroller memory will be constraint relative to the hardware solution chosen (the arduino Uno is roughly 35 kb of total memory)

3.2 Scope of the project

 - the scope of the project includes only the components of pool that require the player to attempt and take a shot
