\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Project Overview}
The purpose of this project is to provide the client with an autonomous solution for a pool playing partner. The system will utilize Visual Recognition (VR) to make its own decisions regarding shot selection and then move accordingly to take that shot.

\subsection{Product Perspective}
This section will outline various interfacing requirements as well as memory constraints of the system.
\subsubsection{System Interfaces}
The only system level interface in this project will be a simple user-facing one for obtaining commands such as: take a shot, move out of the way, or stop motion.
\subsubsection{Hardware Interfaces}
The user will have the ability to interface with the system using hardware either through buttons, sensors or other hardware solutions. This functionality will allow the user to give the system trivial commands relating to the status of the game.
\subsubsection{Software Interfaces}
The software will have two major interfacing requirements. The first will be in the formatting of the table state data that will be passed from MATLAB to the core programming language. The second will be in the formatting of instruction sets to be used by the $\mu$C. These formats must be designed to be syntactically consistent so that they can be understood by both subsystems.
\subsubsection{Communications Interfaces}
This system will have two inter-system communication interfaces:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item VR to PC\\\\
	The communication between the VR and the PC will require the system to output the image takes by the VR to the PC for further computation.
	\item PC to $\mu$C\\\\
	This method of communications defines the method of transferring information from the PC to the $\mu$C that will control the hardware.
	\item $\mu$C to PC\\\\
	The $\mu$C will communicate a response back to the PC so that the PC can be sure that the message was both received and that the command is valid.
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Memory Constraints}
The PC will not be very limited in terms of memory since it will have large memory storage. The limitations of the PC will arise from its RAM memory which may cause the computations to take time.\\\\
The $\mu$C is more heavily constrained by its memory since most $\mu$C use chip memory that is generally in the order of Kilobytes.

	\noindent\textbf{Description}: The system should be able to detect the machine's current physical state at certain location.\\
	\textbf{Rationale}: If the system has a way of verifying the machine's current physical state, it will be able to detect unexpected disturbances. This will lead to higher accuracy of instructions being generated in certain cases as well as enabling the machine to self-correct as necessary.\\
	\textbf{Fit Criterion}: This requirement will have various degrees of success.

\section{Project Issues}
The issues to be addressed consider marketability, competition, safety, liabilities, or any other noticeable concerns.\\
Furthermore, visual recognition, creating a pool table and the structural stability of the machine will be major challenges that must be overcome.
\subsection{Existing Products}
All known existing products are not publicly available. Nevertheless, these projects may affect the clients' view of the product and the overall marketability of the product.

\subsection{Off-the-Shelf Solutions}
Certain concerns involved in the development of this project can be addressed by using what has been created by others. There are various MATLAB libraries that can be leveraged in order to aid in the visual recognition segment of this project. A pool table can be purchased to avoid difficulties in creating a high quality table environment. The structure of the system can be optimized by purchasing high quality metals that are already machined in the appropriate fashion.

\subsection{Risks}
The risks found in this project generally describe the safety considerations found with both the creation and operation of the product. This machine may have quite strong motor and actuators that may be high current or high voltage devices. It is imperative that the user's safety is taken into account and that even a player without any electrical experience will be able to at least be around the table. Another risk is achieving high enough precision to actually make successful shots.

\subsection{User Documentation \& Training}
In order to market the product the user will need to be provided with documentation regarding the operation, safety, and maintenance of the system. Although the product should be designed in a way that promotes ease of use, there must be some form of training required before the user can comfortably use the product. This may include a user manual or videos.
