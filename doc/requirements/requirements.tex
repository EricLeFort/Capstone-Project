\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Project Overview}
The purpose of this project is to provide the client with an autonomous solution for a pool playing partner. The robot will utilize Visual Recognition (VR) to make its own decisions regarding its shot selection and will play the game similar to how a regular opponent will.

\subsection{Product Perspective}
This section will outline various interfacing requirements as well as memory constraints of the system.
\subsubsection{System Interfaces}
%TODO
\subsubsection{Hardware Interfaces}
The user will have the ability to interface with the system using hardware either through buttons, sensors or any other hardware solutions. This functionality will allow the user to give the robot trivial commands relating to the status of the game.
\subsubsection{Software Interfaces}
%TODO
\subsubsection{Communications Interfaces}
This system will have two inter-system communication interfaces:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item VR to PC\\\\
	The communication between the VR and the PC will require the system to output the image takes by the VR to the PC for further computation.
	\item PC to $\mu$C
	This method of communications defines the method of transferring information from the PC to the $\mu$C that will control the hardware.
	\item $\mu$C to PC
	%TODO
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Memory Constraints}
The PC will not be very limited in terms of memory since it will have large memory storage. The limitations of the PC will arise from its RAM memory which may cause the computations to take time.\\\\
The $\mu$C is more heavily constrained by its memory since most uC use chip memory that is general in the order of Kilobytes.

	\noindent\textbf{Description}: Communicate image data from camera to PC.\\
	\textbf{Rationale}: The system will have a separate device for image capture. It is imperative that that device can communicate its data to the PC in order to be used in the VR algorithm.\\
	\textbf{Fit Criterion}: This requirement will be considered satisfied if the data received by the PC is identical to the data transmitted by the camera.\\\\
	\textbf{Originator}: Eric Le Fort\\\\
	\noindent\textbf{Customer Satisfaction}: 0 \hfill 	\textbf{Customer Dissatisfaction}: 0 \hfill\\
	\textbf{Priority}: High \hfill \textbf{Conflicts}: None \hfill\\

\end{framed}

\begin{framed}
	\noindent\textbf{Requirement \#}: 3 \hfill \textbf{Requirement Type}: 1 \hfill\\\\
	\noindent\textbf{Description}: Create model of table state in software using VR.\\
	\textbf{Rationale}: The table must be modelled such that the shot selection algorithm has information to work off of.\\
	\textbf{Fit Criterion}: This requirement will be considered satisfied if the modelling of each ball on the table is accurate to within 1 centimeter of their actual position.\\\\
	\textbf{Originator}: Eric Le Fort\\\\

	\textbf{Originator}: Eric Le Fort\\\\
	\noindent\textbf{Customer Satisfaction}: 2 \hfill 	\textbf{Customer Dissatisfaction}: 4 \hfill\\
	\textbf{Priority}: Medium \hfill \textbf{Conflicts}: None \hfill\\

\begin{framed}
	\noindent\textbf{Requirement \#}: 5 \hfill \textbf{Requirement Type}: 2 \hfill\\\\
	\noindent\textbf{Description}: Communicate the model of the table state from MATLAB to the system's core programming language.\\
	\textbf{Rationale}: MATLAB will only be used to compute VR calculations and a more suitable language will be utilized to handle the rest of the program's functionality. Therefore, the results that MATLAB arrives at must be passed to the other language.\\
	\textbf{Fit Criterion}: This requirement will be considered satisfied if the data received by the core programming language is identical to that computed in MATLAB.\\\\

\begin{framed}
	\noindent\textbf{Requirement \#}: 6 \hfill \textbf{Requirement Type}: 1 \hfill\\\\
	\noindent\textbf{Description}: Create an instruction set for the embedded system based on the selected shot.\\
	\textbf{Rationale}: Once a shot is selected, the system must then determine the necessary steps to take in order for the machine to be able to make the shot. This will include motion of all elements to position the end-effector at a suitable location from machine's current location as well as how the end-effector should strike the cue ball.\\
	\textbf{Fit Criterion}: This requirement will be considered satisfied if the instruction set provided contains all necessary information and that information does in fact instruct the embedded system on how to go about making the selected shot.\\\\

	\noindent\textbf{Requirement \#}: 8 \hfill \textbf{Requirement Type}: 2 \hfill\\\\
	\noindent\textbf{Description}: Communicate a simple response back to the PC indicating the validity of the instruction set received by the $\mu$C.\\
	\textbf{Rationale}: The $\mu$C should generate a response to the PC as to whether the instruction set provided is valid considering the current state of the system. This will act as a contingency if the machine was disturbed (e.g. forced out of position by the user) by alerting the PC that its assumption of the machine's location was wrong.\\
	\textbf{Fit Criterion}: This requirement will be considered satisfied if the response received is identical to the response sent and if the response is correct given the current state of the system.\\\\
	\textbf{Originator}: Eric Le Fort\\\\
	\noindent\textbf{Customer Satisfaction}: 0 \hfill 	\textbf{Customer Dissatisfaction}: 2 \hfill\\

\begin{framed}
	\noindent\textbf{Requirement \#}: 9 \hfill \textbf{Requirement Type}: 1 \hfill\\\\
	\noindent\textbf{Description}: The $\mu$C must be able to interpret the instruction set to real-world controls.\\
	\textbf{Rationale}: The instruction set will be in more abstract terms.  The embedded system must encode these instructions to the equivalent electrical signals.\\

\begin{framed}
	\noindent\textbf{Requirement \#}: 10 \hfill \textbf{Requirement Type}: 4 \hfill\\\\
	\noindent\textbf{Description}: The system should be able to keep track of information pertaining to the machine's current physical state.\\
	\textbf{Rationale}: If the system has a way of verifying the machine's current physical state, it will be able to detect unexpected disturbances. This will lead to higher accuracy of instructions being generated in certain cases as well as enabling the machine to self-correct as necessary.\\
	\textbf{Fit Criterion}: This requirement will have various degrees of success. It will be considered satisfied on its simplest level if it can be used to calibrate the system (i.e. a default starting point to return to when in doubt). Other levels of success would include more set points that can be used as reference.\\\\

\section{Project Issues}
The issues to be addressed consider marketability, competition, safety, liabilities, or any other noticeable
concerns.
\subsection{Existing Products}
All known existing products are not publicly available. Nevertheless, these projects may affect the clients? view of the product and the overall marketability of the product.

\subsection{Off-the-Shelf Solutions}
%TODO Mention VR with MatLab, buying pool table, other existing solutions to difficult aspects of development.

\subsection{Risks}
The risks found in this project generally describe the safety considerations found with both the creation and operation of the product. This robot may have quite strong motor and actuators that may be high current/ high voltage devices. It is imperative that the user?s safety is taken into account and that even a player without any electrical experience will be able to at least be around the table.

\subsection{User Documentation \& Training}
In order to market the product the user will need to be provided with documentation regarding the operation, safety, and maintenance of the system. Although the product should be designed in a way that promotes ease of use, there must be some form of training required before the user can comfortably use the product. This may include a user manual or videos.
