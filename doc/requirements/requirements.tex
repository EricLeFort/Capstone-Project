\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Project Overview}
The purpose of this project is to provide the client with an autonomous solution for a pool playing partner. The system will utilize Visual Recognition (VR) to make its own decisions regarding shot selection and then move accordingly to take that shot.

\subsection{Product Perspective}
This section will outline various interfacing requirements as well as memory constraints of the system.
\subsubsection{System Interfaces}
The only system level interface in this project will be a simple user-facing one for obtaining commands such as: take a shot, move out of the way, or stop motion.
\subsubsection{Hardware Interfaces}
The user will have the ability to interface with the system using hardware either through buttons, sensors or other hardware solutions. This functionality will allow the user to give the system trivial commands relating to the status of the game.
\subsubsection{Software Interfaces}
The software will have two major interfacing requirements. The first will be in the formatting of the table state data that will be passed from the VR program to the core programming language. The second will be in the formatting of instruction sets to be used by the $\mu$C. These formats must be designed to be syntactically consistent so that they can be understood by both subsystems.
\subsubsection{Communications Interfaces}
This system will have two inter-system communication interfaces:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item VR to PC\\\\
	The communication between the VR and the PC will require the system to output the image takes by the VR to the PC for further computation.
	\item PC to $\mu$C\\\\
	This method of communications defines the method of transferring information from the PC to the $\mu$C that will control the hardware.
	\item $\mu$C to PC\\\\
	The $\mu$C will communicate a response back to the PC so that the PC can be sure that the message was both received and that the command is valid.
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Memory Constraints}
The PC will not be very limited in terms of memory since it will have large memory storage. The limitations of the PC will arise from its RAM memory which may cause the computations to take time.\\\\
The $\mu$C is more heavily constrained by its memory since most $\mu$C use chip memory that is generally in the order of Kilobytes.

\subsection{Description of Operation}
This section will describe both normal operation and how the system will handle unexpected events.
\subsubsection{Normal Operation}
First the system must be started. This is done by starting the Android application, starting the PC program, and then starting the $\mu$C program (in that order). Once the system is ready, there are two standard events that this system can take: moving out of the way and taking a shot. Both of these will be described here.\\~\\
Moving involves receiving a request from the user indicating that a move is required. Once this request is received, the system will determine where to move and generate the appropriate control signals to move the machine to that location. After movement has finished, the system will return to an idle state.\\~\\
Taking a shot is the most complicated event that this system will handle. In this case, the machine will first receive a request from the user indicating that the machine should take a shot. The $\mu$C will receive that command and then communicate it to the PC. The PC will first acknowledge that request and then pass on the request to the camera application. The camera application will receive this request, capture an image, and communicate that image back to the PC. Upon receipt of the image, the PC will initiate the VR program. Once the VR program writes its results to the output file, the PC will read its contents into memory. The PC will then determine which shot is the best to take and communicate that shot to the $\mu$C. The $\mu$C will then acknowledge receipt of the shot. Once the $\mu$C has the shot specification, it will compute which signals will move the machine appropriately and then generate those signals.
\subsubsection{Error Handling}
As with all complicated systems, it is possible that certain errors may arise during operation. For example, successful inter-program communication is never taken for granted and so acknowledgements are in place to make sure the communication actually happens. Also, in case of danger or harm being caused by the physical machine, there will be emergency stops to force the machine to cease its operation at any stage of the process.

\section{Project Issues}
The issues to be addressed consider marketability, competition, safety, liabilities, or any other noticeable concerns.\\
Furthermore, visual recognition, creating a pool table and the structural stability of the machine will be major challenges that must be overcome.
\subsection{Existing Products}
All known existing products are not publicly available. Nevertheless, these projects may affect the clients' view of the product and the overall marketability of the product.

\subsection{Off-the-Shelf Solutions}
Certain concerns involved in the development of this project can be addressed by using what has been created by others. There are various libraries that can be leveraged in order to aid in the visual recognition segment of this project. A pool table can be purchased to avoid difficulties in creating a high quality table environment. The structure of the system can be optimized by purchasing high quality metals that are already machined in the appropriate fashion.

\subsection{Risks}
The risks found in this project generally describe the safety considerations found with both the creation and operation of the product. This machine may have quite strong motor and actuators that may be high current or high voltage devices. It is imperative that the user's safety is taken into account and that even a player without any electrical experience will be able to at least be around the table. Another risk is achieving high enough precision to actually make successful shots.

\subsection{User Documentation \& Training}
In order to market the product the user will need to be provided with documentation regarding the operation, safety, and maintenance of the system. Although the product should be designed in a way that promotes ease of use, there must be some form of training required before the user can comfortably use the product. This may include a user manual or videos.
