Hardware - - - High Level Design Meeting Notes


MECHANICAL

X-AXIS -> Rail bolted to side of pool table with track for upper and lower wheels. Ball bearings in wheels for reduced friciton. 
Possibly use I-Beam for rigidity.

Y-AXIS -> Two parallel bars. Slide bearings on each bar.  Dual bar so as to prevent swinging motion from recoil of end-effector.

Z-AXIS -> Fuck that

End-Effector ->  Angled towards table. Retractable striking peice able to move out of way of pool balls once struck. Makes taking
shot of ball along edge much easier. No need to worry about movement in the z-axis.

Rails -> Will need to be larger than the dimensions of the table. X-AXIS and Y-AXIS components will need to have some overhang 
such that end effector can be positioned to take inward facing shots on balls which are located on the edges of the table.

Motors -> Can either be placed on the moving components or be stationary. If placed on moving component, can use stationary 
rack & pinion or stationary belt (open loop) to translate linear motion. If stationary, can use moving belt (closed loop) to 
translate linear motion. Closed loop belt should theoretically have less slippage as compared to rack & pinion or open loop belt
since larger area of contact with gear (wraps around gear as opposed to being tangent to gear).


ELECTRICAL

Loose wires -> Don't want. Can shrink wrap multiple wires together. Can use some kind of spring loaded mechanism to coil loose 
wires (like dog leash). Can run wire through shower curtain type loops along bottom of table. 

Supply (110 V AC) -> Transformer (x V AC) -> AC/DC (x V DC) -> Sensors, Micro Controller, Motors, Motor Controllers, PC, Camera. 
Different components need different voltages, so will likely need to split supply in parallel and feed to separate transformers
with purposefully specific voltage outputs.
